    Geometric Operation includes:
    Scaling
    Translating
    Rotating

    Scaling: Extending an image in either 1 direction or both direction
        say to increase the image size to 2x in X direction
        g[i,2j] = f[i,j]
            this means that the jth row of image gets assigned to the 2jth row of new_image
            It doesn't clear the picture simply.
            say
                f.shape = (5,5)
                according to the transformation the shape of g has to be (5,10)
                which shows that the image has be scaled in X direction.
            But it is clearly visible that some of the columns may get untouched in g. To solve this issue we use a technique called
            'Interpolation'.
            InterPolation means, filling up the pixel with data available in neighbouring pixels.

    Translation:Shifting each pixel in Either or both direction
        g[i,j+x]   = f[i,j]
    or, g[i+y,j]   = f[i,j]
    or, g[i+y,j+x] = f[i,j]
        
        Empty Pixels are marked 0

    Rotation: Rotation simply means rotating an image around its centre of origin Î¸ degrees

    All these Transformation can be done with the help of AFFINE TRANSFORMATION
    say,
        x' = a*x + tx
        y' = d*y + ty

        x'      a   0       x        tx
      |   | = |        |  |   |  + |     |
        y'      0   b       y        ty
